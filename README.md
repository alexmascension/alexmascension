- 👋 Hi, I'm @alexmascension
- 💻 I'm a PhD student at Biodonostia Health Research Institute, in Donostia (Basque Country, Spain)
- 🔬 My PhD goes about single cell RNA seq in skin. With this method I can study the different cells in our skin (healthy or injured), and see how complex this tissue is!
- 📊 I'm interested in data analysis visualization. I love playing with data and see what can I extract from them! 
- ♀️♂️🖐🏻🖐🏽🖐🏿 I'm also interested in how biases in the data can affect ML algorithm-based important decisions.
- 📫 You can find me in ![GitLab](https://gitlab.com/alexmascension), ![Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexmascension)!

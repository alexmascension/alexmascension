👋 Hi, I'm @alexmascension (he/they 🏳️‍🌈)

💻 I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at Biogipuzkoa Health Research Institute (Basque Country, Spain).

🔬 During my PhD I studied the importance and heterogeneity of fibroblasts within our skin using single-cell RNA-seq. With this method I can study the different cells in our skin (healthy or injured), and see how complex this tissue is!

🧠 I'm currently undergoing several research projects where I study the effects of several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis! 

📊 I love proper data analysis and how can I extract the most of my data with different visualizations. I love playing with data and see what can I learn from them! 

♀️♂️🖐🏻🖐🏽🖐🏿 I'm also interested in how can we integrate social diversity within our research. More specifically, I am beginning to learn more about how sexual characteristics, like X and Y chromosomes, are fundamental to explain heterogeneity in neurodegeneration.
